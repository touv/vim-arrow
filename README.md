# arrow.vim - provide shortcuts to efficiently use the arrow keys

It is a Vim plugin that will allow you to simply cheat. You could also use the arrow keys to select and move without knowing the standard keys !
If you are a fan or an advanced user, run away and install [dogmatic.vim](https://github.com/mrmargolis/dogmatic.vim) !

## Installation
I recommend using vundle or pathogen to manage your Vim plugins.  If you wish to manually
install this plugin, copy the arrow.vim file into your ~/.vim/plugin
directory.
